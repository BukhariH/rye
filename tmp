[ANN] Rye 0.8.0 Released (better support for executing SSH commands in parallel)

Rye: Run SSH commands on a bunch of machines at the same time (from Ruby) in a safe and tubular way.

Homepage: http://github.com/delano/rye/
Installation: gem install rye

Example:

rbox = Rye::Box.new('localhost')

# SSH commands are run as methods on the Rye::Box object
puts rbox.uptime                              # => 11:02 up 16:01, 3 users

rset = Rye::Set.new('default', :parallel => true)
rset.add_keys('/private/key/path')    # For passwordless logins
rset.add_boxes(rbox, '127.0.0.1')    # Add boxes as objects or hostnames

# Running a command on multiple machines
p rset.uptime  # => [[14:19:02 up 32 days, 19:35 ...], [14:19:02 up 30 days, 01:35]]


Changes:
* FIXED: safely and unsafely (Rye::Box) now return the block return value
* ADDED: Rye::Set#parallel and Rye::Set#parallel= methods
* ADDED: Rye::Box#quietly
* CHANGE: Updated Rye::Set#inspect and Rye::Set#to_s
* CHANGE: Exception hook now receives: ex, cmd, user, host, nickname
* CHANGE: Increased Kernel.sleep to 0.03 in Rye::Set.run_command_parallel
* CHANGE: Renamed Rye::Cmd#upload and Rye::Cmd#download to file_upload and file_download
* CHANGE: Rye::Cmd#file_exists? now executes quietly (doesnâ€™t pollute logging)
